DINOSAUR

Press the button to start.

You can move the joystick left and right to move the player. Pressing the button will cause you to jump. You can still move through the air after jumping.

Obstacles will come in from the right side of the screen. If you collide with an obstacle, you lose. Your goal is to survive for as long as possible.

Your score increases every second that you survive for. The longer you survive, the higher your score.

After losing, the screen will display 'GAME OVER' and your score. Press the jump button to play again.
